# JavaScript Coding Quiz

## Description
This is a coding quiz made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
This website is designed to quiz a user on their basic knowledge of JavaScript. 

## How It Works 
The user goes through the quiz by clicking the buttons and submitting their answers. <br>

As soon as the user clicks start, there is a timer that is counting down from 100. If a user gets a question incorrectly, they lose 5 seconds from the timer.  <br>


On the other hand, if the user answers correctly they get points added to their score. The user is informed which answer is correct or incorrect. <br>

At the end of the quiz or when the time runs out, the user will type their initials and submit their score. 
 These scores will be stored into local storage. 
 The local storage can be cleared by the user.
